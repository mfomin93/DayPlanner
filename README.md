One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

The purpose of the homework is to create a day planner. This day planner has a time range of 9am-5pm broken down by hour. Each hour is a field that you can click and type in a note for that hour. This note will be saved even if you close the browser. 

### Prerequisites

Any browser such as Chrome, Safari, Mozilla, etc.

### Day Planner Project Page

Opening the URL to the project will land you on the planner directly. If you are within 9-5am, depending on the hour it will be highlighted green. Gray for current and Red for past time.
